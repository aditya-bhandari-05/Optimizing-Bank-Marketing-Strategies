# Banking Marketing Optimization Project

In an increasingly competitive banking landscape, the efficacy of marketing campaigns significantly impacts a bank's revenue streams. Term deposits, a vital aspect of a bank's income, hinges on effectively identifying potential customers willing to invest. The prevailing challenge for banks lies in optimizing marketing strategies, particularly within telephonic campaigns, a historically potent but cost-intensive avenue. Identifying high-probability prospects before investing in expansive call centers can significantly alleviate operational costs while optimizing campaign efficiency. Our project delves into the realm of predictive modeling using data from a direct marketing campaign undertaken by a Portuguese banking institution. 

The focus of this project revolved around utilizing data-driven methodologies to optimize the identification of individuals exhibiting a higher propensity to invest in term deposits. By combining exploratory data analysis techniques and predictive modeling, our objective was not only to comprehend the underlying patterns within the dataset but also to develop robust models capable of anticipating and understanding customer behaviors associated with term deposit subscriptions. 

The datasets, comprising train.csv (45,211 rows) and test.csv (4521 rows), record the outcomes of telephonic marketing campaigns between May 2008 and November 2010. These datasets encapsulate crucial customer interactions, allowing us to delve into the nuances of customer responses to marketing initiatives.  

This report is an account of our findings, methodologies employed, and the predictive models devised from the extensive exploration of this banking dataset. By elucidating our approach and outcomes, we aim to furnish actionable insights to banking institutions seeking to optimize their marketing strategies and enhance their term deposit subscription rates. 

## Project Highlights:

**Objective:** Optimize the identification of potential term deposit investors using data-driven methodologies.

**Approach:** Blend of exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling to unravel customer behavior patterns.

**Datasets:** Train.csv (45,211 rows) and test.csv (4,521 rows) from telephonic campaigns conducted between May 2008 and November 2010.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Our initial phase involved a thorough exploration using summary statistics and diverse visualizations. EDA unveiled dataset structures, identified patterns, and relationships, forming the foundation for subsequent modeling decisions.


## Data Balancing:
Addressing class imbalances is crucial for robust model performance. We employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples, ensuring a balanced representation of classes and mitigating biases.


## Predictive Modeling Techniques:
After data balancing, logistic regression emerged as a key player. Ideal for binary classification tasks, it provides interpretable results, aiding decision-makers in understanding factors influencing customer decisions.


## Logistic Regression Insights:

**Advantages:** Interpretable coefficients facilitate understanding of variable impacts.

**Considerations:** Assumes a linear relationship; may face challenges with highly imbalanced datasets.

**Threshold Adjustment:** Adapting the classification threshold mitigates imbalances, a crucial feature for banking decisions.


## Libraries Used:

**Pandas:** Data manipulation

**Scikit Learn:** Machine learning models

**Imbalanced-learn:** Data balancing
